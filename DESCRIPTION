Description: The purpose of this package is to be an easily accessible
    collection of various typological databases that are available online but
    usually are cumbersome to load and/or use. In addition to the datasets, the
    package provides a data frame that matches different types of language codes
    (such as Glottolog, ISO 639.3 and others).
